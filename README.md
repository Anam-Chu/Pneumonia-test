# Pneumonia-Daignosis
Diagnosis of Pneumonia using CNN

Set up the directory structure for the dataset:

Create a folder named "Pneumonia" in the root directory.
Inside the "Pneumonia" folder, create three subfolders: "train", "val", and "test".
Move the training images to the "train" folder, validation images to the "val" folder, and testing images to the "test" folder.
Organize the training images into two subfolders: "NORMAL" and "PNEUMONIA".


The script will train the CNN model using the provided training and validation images. Once the desired accuracy (96% or higher) is reached during training, it will stop training early. The model summary will be displayed.

After training, the script will evaluate the model's accuracy on the testing images and display the result.


This code is based on the implementation of CNN models using Keras and TensorFlow.
The dataset used in this project is the Pneumonia Chest X-ray Images from Kaggle.
